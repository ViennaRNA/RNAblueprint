### Most important configure options are:

    --prefix Specify an installation path prefix
    --with-boost Specify the installation directory of the boost library
    --disable-swig Disable all SWIG scripting interfaces
    --enable-libGMP Enable the calculation of big numbers with multiprecision
    --disable-openmp Disable the usage of parallel computation

TIP: You might want call ./configure â€“help for all install options!

## Documentation
